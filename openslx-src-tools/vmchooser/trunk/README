VM Chooser Helper Program
==================================

This is the program used by the vmchooser-plugin, which
is part of the openslx-system.



==================================
FAQ
==================================

What does it do?
 It handles xml-files for the virtual-machines plugins 
 or linux sessions after the login-screen.
 If chosen, it starts the proper virtualizer script or the linux session
 as a background process and terminates itself.

How can I build it?
 This project has been converted to cmake and can be built by
 "cmake <Path to vmchooser source> && make". With cmake, this can be built
 in an arbitrary directory.

 UPDATE: You can build it by changing into the directory "build", calling "./make.sh"

How can I install it?
 See below

What command-line parameters are available?
 "-p|--path=" In this (abolute) path are your xml-files for the virtualizer-plugin
 "-l|--lpath=" In this (absolute) path are your linux sessions
 "-g|--group=" Show only entries valid for this group
 "-h|--help" Show help

==================================


You just need to compile this, if you have local changes.
The most recent svn version is also included in binary format 
in the main folder of this openslx-distribution.

Enter "cmake <path to vmchooser source> && make" to compile everything.

UPDATE: There is a script in the build-directory to simplify building.

Enter "cp vmchooser ../../../../openslx/trunk/os-plugins/plugins/vmchooser/files/" 
to install it to the proper path of the svn distribution of openslx 
(only if the build-path is [SVN ROOT]/openslx-src-tools/vmchooser/trunk/somefolder/). 

Do not forget to enter "make install" in [SVN ROOT]/openslx/trunk .

Needed libraries to compile:
 - All sorts of X libs and development files
 - fltk-2 (included - see note *)
 - libxml2 (included - libxml2-dev on Ubuntu)
 
 * Boost Libraries (static - dynamic versions can 
 	be enabled by changing the CMakelists.txt -
 	specifically commenting out the 
 	Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS variable definition)
   (libboost-dev/libboost-[regex|filesystem|system]-dev on Ubuntu) 
 - libboost-regex_s
 - libboost_filesystem_s
 - libboost_system_s
 
Most probably (for fltk2-includes):
 - libpng-dev (libpng12-dev on Ubuntu)
 - libjpeg-dev (libjpeg-dev on Ubuntu)
 - libxi-dev (libxi-dev on Ubuntu)
 - libxinerama-dev (libxinerama-dev on Ubuntu)
 - libxrender-dev (libxrender-dev on Ubuntu)
 - libxconfig1-dev (libxconfig1-dev on Ubuntu)
 - libxft-dev (libxft-dev on Ubuntu)

Needed libraries to run:
 - All sorts of X libs
 - libxml2

===================================
* Some static libraries of fltk - svn version - and libxml2 are located 
in fltk/ and libxml2/ and are used to link against this program.
- as images are enabled, you should have libjpeg and libpng too.
