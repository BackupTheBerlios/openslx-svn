==================================
FAQ
==================================

What does it do?
 It handles xml-files for the virtual-machines plugins 
 or linux sessions after the login-screen.
 If chosen, it starts the proper virtualizer script or the linux session
 as a background process and terminates itself.

How can I install it?
 Type "make install" in the vmchooser Folder and it gets installed
 in the right folder (if you have the whole svn structure locally).
 Then you have to install the "vmchooser"-plugin to your VendorOS.

What command-line parameters are available?
 "-p|--path=" In this (abolute) path are your xml-files for the virtualizer-plugin
 "-l|--lpath=" In this (absolute) path are your linux sessions
 "-g|--group=" Show only entries valid for this group
 "-h|--help" Show help
