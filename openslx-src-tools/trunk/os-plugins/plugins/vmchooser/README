VM Chooser Helper Program
==================================

This is the program used by the vmchooser-plugin, which
is part of the openslx-system.

You just need to compile this, if you have local changes.
The most recent svn version is also included in binary format 
in the main folder of this openslx-distribution.

Enter "make" to compile everything.
Enter "make install" to install it to the proper path 
of the svn distribution of openslx. Do not forget to
enter "make install" in openslx/trunk .

Needed libraries to compile:
 - All sorts of X libs
 - fltk-2 (see note *)
 - libxml2
 - libboost-regex_s (static - 
   a dynamic version can be enabled by changing the Makefile)

Needed libraries to run:
 - All sorts of X libs
 - libxml2

===================================
* Some static libraries of fltk-2 - svn version - are located 
in fltk-2/ and could be used to link against this program.
- as images are enabled, you should have libjpeg and libpng too.
