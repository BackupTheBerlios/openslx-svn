OpenSLX - Open StateLess eXtensions version 4.1

OpenSLX is a software package for setting up, managing and booting of
"stateless client systems" (a.k.a. "thin clients").

Information on installation and the required packages can be found in
the doc/ folder (especially intro.txt). Further information is available
through the web pages:

--> http://www.openslx.org                                (project)
--> http://www.openslx.org/de/doc/Linux_Stateless_Clients (documentation)
--> http://lists.openslx.org                              (mailing lists)


SNAPSHOT-RELEASES
-----------------
The snapshot-releases of OpenSLX are being made to expose the software to a 
wider audience in order to gain more feedback on what works and what doesn't.

New snapshots will be released in short timeframes - at least once a month -
such that we can react to feedback promptly. Aim of the snapshot phase is to
stabilize the software in preparation for the upcoming beta release.

Upgrading from one snapshot to the other should be a seamless operation, as
eventual differences between the DB-schema should be adjusted automatically.
Only for *downgrades*, manual intervention might be needed.


NOTES ABOUT THIS SNAPSHOT
-------------------------
* Cloning is the only form of vendor-OS creation we can currently recommend
  for a vendor-OS that is meant to be run in production.
  The fresh installation of a vendor-OS into a folder does not work properly
  across all distributions, yet, so while it may be interesting to experiment
  in that field, problems are more likely.


FEEDBACK
