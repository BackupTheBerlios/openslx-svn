rewrite of runvmware and all other scripts needed for virtualisation
with vmware or virtualbox.
Project not finished yet! Everything not enough testet!

Earlier checkin, cause it was requested.

Structure and files:
- menulist-creator:
            creates desktop entrys and runvmwares runscripts from
            template using xml files
- templates/runvmware-v2:
            runvmware-v2 template, needed by menulist-creator
- templates/Vorlage_VMWareImageAdministrator.xml:
            example xml file with verbose description

Goal:
- better documentation of source and virtualisation
- easier source, unneeded parts removed
- better understanding for persons who are new to the project, without
  reading 1k lines of source
- no complicated vmmenu structure, preventing easy integration of new
  features depending on the image
