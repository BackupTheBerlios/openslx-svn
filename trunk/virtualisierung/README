rewrite of runvmware and all other scripts needed for virtualisation
with vmware or virtualbox.
Project not finished yet! Everything not enough testet!

Earlier checkin, cause it was requested.

Goal:
- better documentation of source and virtualisation
- easier source, unneeded parts removed
- better understanding for persons who are new to the project, without
  reading 1k lines of source
- no complicated vmmenu structure, preventing easy integration of new
  features depending on the image
