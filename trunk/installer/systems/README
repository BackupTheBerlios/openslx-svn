In this sub directory of /etc/opt/openslx/ we store the configuration files
for operating systems installed with slxossetup.

Any file named BASE_FILE_* is installed into the destination directory before
any package install action takes place.

Therfore the suffix of BASE_FILE has the destination path encoded in the
filename.  Any __ is replaced by a single /.  Therfore BASE_FILE_etc__passwd
for example will be copied to the destination, stage1 directory,
/var/opt/openslx/stage1/<system-name>/etc/passwd
