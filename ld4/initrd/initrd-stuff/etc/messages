init_errmsg="functions file contains a lot of script \
functionality. Without this\ninit script will not run."
init_mff="The main $init_errmsg"
init_dff="The distro $init_errmsg"
init_dscf="The distribution specific configuration file could not be found"
init_errnbd="  Failed to load \
module ${NBD}.ko. It is needed if you intend to use\n  network block \
device (D)NBD for the client as root filesystem."
init_errip="  Unable to setup at \
least basic functionality, because no IP configuration\n  available. You \
might pass that information via kernel command line\n  through setting of \
'ipappend 1' in pxelinux.cfg/* or just enable dhcp\n  or ldap. They are \
enabled via tokens ('ldap' or 'dhcp') in kernel\n  command line."
init_errldap="  Unable to setup at \
least basic functionality, because no IP configuration\n  available. Please \
beware - ldap works only in combination of either\n  ipappend or similar or \
with dhcp!"
init_errnwad="  Failed to load the network \
adaptor modules defined via mkdxsinitrd\n  run. Please rerun and list the \
appropriate modules (without .ko)."

error_shell="Running shell for debugging purposes now ...\n"
error_modload="Failed to load module "

error_iptool="  No tool for local IP configuration found. You should at \
least add\n  one of the following programs to your ramdisk: ip \
ipconfig\n  ifconfig."
error_nfs="  Mount of root filesystem via NFS was requested via kernel command \
line\nbut failed. There might be the following reasons for that:\n\
* No nfs.ko module could be loaded and no NFS support was present in the\n\
running kernel - see error messages above\n\
* You tried to mount from wrong server or path ($nfsroot)\n\
* No NFS server is running or you do not have permissions"
error_portm="  Portmapper should be present, if normal mount \
command is used. Please\n  check your initial ramdisk setup (mkdxsinitrd)."
error_mntt="  No suitable mount tool found."
error_dhcp="  The following problems could produce that error:\n\
  * The af_packet.ko module is either not loaded nor present in kernel.\n\
  * No network device is present - either no module matching the hardware\n\
    was loaded nor present in kernel.\n  You might want to run 'lsmod'."
