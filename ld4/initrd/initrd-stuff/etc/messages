# messages from init
init_errmsg="functions file contains a lot of script \
functionality. Without this\ninit script will not run."
init_mff="The main $init_errmsg"
init_dff="The distro $init_errmsg"
init_dscf="The distribution specific configuration file could not be found"
init_errip="  Unable to setup at \
least basic functionality, because no IP configuration\n  available. You \
might pass that information via kernel command line\n  through setting of \
'ipappend 1' in pxelinux.cfg/* or just enable dhcp\n  or ldap. They are \
enabled via tokens ('ldap' or 'dhcp') in kernel\n  command line."
init_errldap="  Unable to setup at \
least basic functionality, because no IP configuration\n  available. Please \
beware - ldap works only in combination of either\n  ipappend or similar or \
with dhcp!"
init_errnwad="  Failed to load the network \
adaptor modules defined via mkdxsinitrd\n  run. Please rerun and list the \
appropriate modules (without .ko)."
init_errdhcp="  Did not get complete IP \
configuration via DHCP. You may want to add\n  a vendor code identifier \
via kernel commandline (vci=VCI)."
init_errnbd="  Failed to load \
module ${NBD}.ko. It is needed if you intend to use\n  network block \
device (D)NBD for the client as root filesystem."
init_nbdcl="  Failed to start \
the network block device client. Unable to mount root\n  filesystem."
init_nbddev="  For some reason the network block device /dev/${NBD}0 never \
appeared.\n  You might want to check udev or your list of static device \
files."
init_moddir="  The requested modules directory does not exist. That could \
mean:\n  * The kernel was updated but mkdxsinitrd was not run afterwards.\n\
  * The mounted filesystem does not contain the modules directory at all.\n\
  You might want to check the list of mounted filesystems and if /mnt is\n\
  not empty run 'ls /mnt/lib/modules' to check."
init_loadufs="  Loading of UnionFS failed - Either module is not present or \
module\n  does not match the running kernel. If you do not want to see this \
\n  message remove the token 'unionfs' from kernel command line."
init_loadcow="  Loading of Copy On Write (COW - special block device) module \
failed -\n  Either module is not present or module does not match the \
running\n  kernel. If you do not want to see this message remove the token \
'cowloop' from kernel command line."
init_cownonbd="  Loading of cow module is of no sense if no network block \
device is used or\n  UnionFS was specified as read write layer too. Remove \
UnionFS token from\n  kernel commandline if cowloop should be used instead."
init_nfs="  Mount of root filesystem via NFS was requested via kernel command \
line\nbut failed. There might be the following reasons for that:\n\
* No nfs.ko module could be loaded and no NFS support was present in the\n\
running kernel - see error messages above\n\
* You tried to mount from wrong server or path ($nfsroot)\n\
* No NFS server is running or you do not have permissions"
init_ldcfg="Starting ldconfig - switch it off via kernel cmdline option \
'noldsc'"
init_errlog="Unable to create the logfile configuration in \
/etc/${D_SYSCONFDIR}. That\n  might indicate some severe error."
init_fstab="Failed to create /etc/fstab in the clients root filesystem. The\n\
  noexistence of the file might produce some unexpected behaviour of\n\
  mount commands."
init_errldcfg="  For some reason the generation of ld.so.cache did not \
finish in time."
init_infldcfg="  You decided not to recreate \
/etc/ld.so.cache file. That might cause errors\n  if libraries are installed \
after this file was created on server."
init_errcfg="of this client did not finish in\n  time. You might check the \
process list and list the modules loaded until\n  now."
init_errhw="  For some reason the hardware autoconfig $init_errcfg"
init_errsw="  For some reason the software configuration  $init_errcfg"
init_wait="  Waited $i ticks to unmount kernel module directory ..."
init_errumnt="  Unmount of the kernel modules directory \
failed for some reason. Some\n  modprobe still active!?"
init_erritab="  The file /etc/inittab does not exist or \
is no regular one. It is needed\n  for the bootup procedure to follow."
init_errsys="  Unmount of the kernel sys directory \
failed for some\nreason.  You will get some error messages that some files \
could not be\n  removed."
init_runinit="  Could not execute \
run-init due to missing command or wrong\n  parameters given."

error_modload="Failed to load module "

error_iptool="  No tool for local IP configuration found. You should at \
least add\n  one of the following programs to your ramdisk: ip \
ipconfig\n  ifconfig."
error_portm="  Portmapper should be present, if normal mount \
command is used. Please\n  check your initial ramdisk setup (mkdxsinitrd)."
error_mntt="  No suitable mount tool found."
error_nodhcp="  You tried to configure system via dhcp, but no usable dhcp\n\
  client could be found. Please check that you have some client from\n\
  the following list installed: dhclient dhcpcd pump ipconfig."
error_dhcp="  The following problems could produce that error:\n\
  * The af_packet.ko module is either not loaded nor present in kernel.\n\
  * No network device is present - either no module matching the hardware\n\
    was loaded nor present in kernel.\n  You might want to run 'lsmod'."

scfg_nfs="  Mount of some NFS source failed ..."
scfg_vmdir="  For some reason the runvmware script is not available for \
copying. That\n  could be the result of failed mount or simply missing \
file on\n  server."
scfg_erradir="  Only one directory level is allowed to hook up automounter \
to and the\n  directory should exist (on the servers export) or should be \
creatable\n  (e.g. because of UnionFS writeable root directory)."
