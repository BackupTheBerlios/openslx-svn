OpenSLX is a software package for setting up, managing and booting of
"stateless client systems" (a.k.a. "diskless X stations").

the doc/ folder (especially intro.txt). Further information is available

NOTES ABOUT THIS PRE-RELEASE
-------------------------
* Cloning is the only form of vendor-OS creation we can currently recommend
  for a vendor-OS that is meant to be run in production.
  The fresh installation of a vendor-OS into a folder does not work properly
  across all distributions, yet, so while it may be interesting to experiment
  in that field, problems are more likely.


FEEDBACK

Have fun,
