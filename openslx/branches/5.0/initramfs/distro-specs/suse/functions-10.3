# configuration script for OpenSuSE 10.3 to configure linux stateless clients
# (included by init, hwautocfg, servconfig within InitialRamFS after 
# inclusion of the main functions file). This file is the main base for the
# several SuSE distro versions

# settings of central variables (formerly done via config-*, these variables
# are disputable ...)
# D_DIRINBINDMNT - lists of directories to be created in bind mounted rw
# part of the client filesystem
# D_RODIRSINRW - ReadOnly Directories in RW part of filesystem to save on 
# TempFS usage
# D_DIRINDXS - directories in client filesystem which should be present 
# anyhow

# no changes from functions-default by now
