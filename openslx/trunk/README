OpenSLX - Open StateLess eXtensions version 4.9

OpenSLX is a software package for setting up, managing and booting of
"stateless client systems" (a.k.a. "diskless X stations").

Information on installation and the required packages can be found in
the doc/ folder (especially intro.txt). Further information is available
through the web pages:

--> http://www.openslx.org                                (project)

SVN-RELEASES
-----------------
At the moment only SVN releases are available ...

New versions will be released in short timeframes - at least once a month -
such that we can react to feedback promptly. Aim of the svn head phase is to
stabilize the software in preparation for the upcoming beta release.

Upgrading from one svn release to the other should be a seamless operation, as
eventual differences between the DB-schema should be adjusted automatically.
Only for *downgrades*, manual intervention might be needed.


NOTES ABOUT THIS SVN-RELEASE
-------------------------
* Cloning is the only form of vendor-OS creation we can currently recommend
  for a vendor-OS that is meant to be run in production.
  The fresh installation of a vendor-OS into a folder does not work properly
  across all distributions, yet, so while it may be interesting to experiment
  in that field, problems are more likely.


FEEDBACK
--------
Questions, wishes and general feedback are very welcome. Please direct them
to the appropriate mailing list, in this case the english users list:

    mailto:openslx-users@openslx.org

Have fun,

    the OpenSLX-team
