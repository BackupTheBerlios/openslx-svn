init_errmsg="The functions file contains a lot of slx scripts \
functionality. Without this\ninit script will not run."
init_mff="The main $init_errmsg"
init_dff="The distro $init_errmsg"
init_sscf="The slx configuration variables could not be found. Please
provide the slxconfig file."
init_noeth="  Unable to configure the ethernet device (eth0). Please check \
for an\n  appropriate kernel module."
init_errip="  Unable to setup at \
least basic functionality, because no IP configuration\n  available. You \
might pass that information via kernel command line\n  through setting of \
'ipappend 1' in pxelinux.cfg/* or just enable dhcp\n  or ldap. They are \
enabled via tokens ('ldap' or 'dhcp') in kernel\n  command line."
init_errldap="  Unable to setup at \
least basic functionality, because no IP configuration\n  available. Please \
beware - ldap works only in combination of either\n  ipappend or similar or \
with dhcp!"
init_errnwad="  Failed to load the network adaptor modules added via \
slxconfig-demuxer\n  run. Please reconfigure the module list and add the \
appropriate modules\n  without *.ko suffix."
init_bootmac="  If you have more than one ethernet adaptor present in your \
machine or using\n  a NVidia chipset then it would be advisable to switch on \
passing of the\n  boot MAC address via kernel commandline (IPAPPEND=3) in \
your PXElinux\n  configuration."
init_nveth="  Your system uses a NVidia ethernet chip which might to fail to \
get the\n  original MAC address assigned. Use IPAPPEND=3 in your PXElinux \
configuration\n  to get the boot MAC address passed on."
init_errdhcp="  Did not get complete IP \
configuration via DHCP. You may want to add\n  a vendor code identifier \
via kernel commandline (vci=VCI)."
init_erripcfg="  Up to now no IP configuration is available. If there is any \
local file config\n  the system may work locally."
init_errbld="  Failed to load \
module ${NBD}.ko. It is needed if you intend to use\n  network block \
device (D)NBD for the client as root filesystem."
init_nbdcl="  Failed to start the network block device client. Unable to \
mount root\n  filesystem."
init_nbddev="  For some reason the network block device /dev/${NBD}0 never \
appeared.\n  You might want to check udev or your list of static device \
files."
init_dnbd2s="  After 100 retries, it was not possible to start the dnbd2 \
service. Please\n  check that at least one server is available. You might \
use the\n  /sys/block/vnbd0 interface for this."
init_moddir="  The requested modules directory does not exist. That could \
mean:\n  * The kernel was updated but the demuxer was not run afterwards.\n\
  * The mounted filesystem does not contain the modules directory at all.\n\
  You might want to check the list of mounted filesystems and if /mnt is\n\
  not empty run 'ls /mnt/lib/modules' to check."
init_loadaufs="  Loading of AUFS and/or UnionFS failed - Either the module(s) \
are not\n  present or do not match the running kernel. If you do not want to \
see\n  this message add the token(s) 'noaufs'/'nounionfs' to your kernel \
command\n  line or remove the modules from your kernel module directory."
init_loadunions="  Stacking of directories failed, because UnionFS/AUFS is not \
loaded."
init_loadcow="  Loading of Copy On Write (COW - special block device) module \
failed -\n  Either module is not present or module does not match the \
running\n  kernel. If you do not want to see this message remove the token \
'cowloop' from kernel command line."
init_cownobld="  Loading of cow module is of no sense if no network/other block \
device is used or\n  UnionFS/AUFS was specified as read write layer too. Remove \
UnionFS/AUFS token from\n  kernel commandline if cowloop should be used instead."
init_nfs="  Mount of root filesystem via NFS was requested via kernel command \
line\nbut failed. There might be the following reasons for that:\n\
* No nfs.ko module could be loaded and no NFS support was present in the\n\
running kernel - see error messages above\n\
* You tried to mount from wrong server or path ($nfsroot)\n\
* No NFS server is running or you do not have permissions"
init_ldcfg="  Starting ldconfig - normally switched off. Enable it via kernel \
cmdline option\n  'noldsc'. You might have/want to add additional library \
pathes to the\n  ld.so.conf file."
init_errlog="  Unable to create the logfile configuration in \
/etc/${D_SYSCONFDIR}. That\n  might indicate some severe error."
init_fstab="  Failed to create /etc/fstab in the clients root filesystem. The\n\
  noexistence of the file might produce some unexpected behaviour of\n\
  mount commands."
init_errldcfg="  For some reason the generation of ld.so.cache did not \
finish in time."
init_infldcfg="  You decided not to recreate \
/etc/ld.so.cache file. That might cause errors\n  if libraries are installed \
after this file was created on server."
init_errlfg="  The ConfTGZ filesource was some local device which was not \
mounted successfully.\n  Either the wrong device was given or the filesystem \
is not known to the kernel."
init_errcfg="of this client did not finish in\n  time. You might check the \
process list and list the modules loaded until\n  now."
init_errhw="  For some reason the hardware autoconfig $init_errcfg"
init_errxorg="  For some reason no xorg.conf appeared, check xconfig!" 
init_errsw="  For some reason the software configuration  $init_errcfg"
init_wait="  Waited $ticks ticks to unmount kernel module directory ..."
init_errumnt="  Unmount of the kernel modules directory \
failed for some reason. Some\n  modprobe process still active!?"
init_erritab="  The file /etc/inittab does not exist or is no regular one. It \
is needed\n  for the bootup procedure to follow. If upstart is used instead no \
inittab\n  is needed any more, but a proper configured events.d."
init_errsys="  Unmount of the kernel sys directory \
failed for some\nreason.  You will get some error messages that some files \
could not be\n  removed."
init_runinit="  Could not execute run-init due to missing command or wrong\n  \
parameters given."
init_picfg="  The plugin configuration directory is missing. This could be due \
to failed\n  config get process at the beginning of stage3 setup. Either \
requested\n  configuration file is missing in ~/client-config/<system> or a \
general\n  transmission error."

error_nodhcp="  You tried to configure system via dhcp, but no usable dhcp\n\
  client could be found. Please check that you have some client from\n\
  the following list installed: dhclient dhcpcd pump ipconfig."
error_dhcp="  The following problems could produce that error:\n\
  * The af_packet.ko module is either not loaded nor present in kernel.\n\
  * No network device is present - either no module matching the hardware\n\
    was loaded nor present in kernel.\n  You might want to run 'lsmod'."
error_dhclient="  Fatal error occured while trying to run dhclient.\n\
