How busybox (version 1.13.1) is created:

1. Get our current sources from openslx-src-tools/trunk/busybox
2. bind mount the busybox folder to the correspoding uclibc-build-environment
   folder (see http://www.openslx.org/wiki/openslx/GentooUclibcChroot for
   how to create such an environment)
3. chroot into the uclibc-build-environment
4. cd into the bind-mounted busybox folder
5. make oldconfig and adjust the configuration if required.
6. build busybox (make)
