ToDo!! There is an example script vmware-startscript which should be
completed and incorporated into Stage1 plugin installer. It should be
modified to look like the choosen vendor-os start scripts!

The original /etc/init.d/vmware /etc/vmware/locations
files aren't needed any more!!


Files
- client-config.xml.default
  Describes how the xml config needs to look like which will be used by
  the Virtual Machine (see nvram below). Currently used internal and
  shouldn't affect normal OpenSLX users. Data will be available on every
  OpenSLX Client.
- nvram.5.0
  This nvram supports a second Floppy drive. Helpfull if you want to
  get some data from linux to your Windows VirtualMachine (like
  Scanner-IP or Userinformation)
- runvmware-player-v1 and runvmware-player-v2
  The main script which will configure and start the Virtual Machine.
  Two different, depending on the player-version
- Vorlage_VMwareImageAdministrator.xml
  This example files shows which VMware features are configureable for
  each virtual machine.
  Should be moved sooner or later to the vm-chooser plugin
- install-vmpl2.0.sh
  Install script, which will download and install vmplayer v2.0 if choosen
- mkdosfs
  linked against uclib for creating dos-formatted floppies for data 
  transport between host and guest (needed in stage3)
