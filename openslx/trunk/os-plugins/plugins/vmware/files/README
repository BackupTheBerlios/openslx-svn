ToDo!! There is an example script vmware-startscript which should be
completed and incorporated into Stage1 plugin installer. It should be
modified to look like the choosen vendor-os start scripts!

The original /etc/init.d/vmware /etc/vmware/locations
files aren't needed any more!!


Files
- nvram.5.0
  This nvram supports a second Floppy drive. Helpfull if you want to
  get some data from linux to your Windows VirtualMachine (like
  Scanner-IP or Userinformation)
- runvmware-player-v1 and runvmware-player-v2
  The main script which will configure and start the Virtual Machine.
  Two different, depending on the player-version
- Vorlage_VMwareImageAdministrator.xml
  This example files shows which VMware features are configureable for
  each virtual machine.
  Should be moved sooner or later to the vm-chooser plugin
- install-vmpl.sh
  Install script, can handle different vmware version installations
- mkdosfs
  linked against uclib for creating dos-formatted floppies for data 
  transport between host and guest (needed in stage3)
