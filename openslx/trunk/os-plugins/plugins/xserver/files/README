ati-install.sh: Installer for ATI drivers
nvidia-install.sh: Installer for NVIDIA drivers

Currently in development and not useable!


Infos about ati-packages:
Most are identical, even when 64bit packages have a different name
Only a couple of cards have its own special package. We need to
investigate, if they are different or one package works for all.

Infos about nvidia packages:
they seem to differ much more as ati if you search directly for a
specific graphic card. But if you take a look on
http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html there seem to be just 3 different
versions - all for different architectures (ia32, ia64, amd64)
