VirtualMachine Chooser - plugin

This Plugin uses an additionally provided program to display a list of virtual
machine sessions (vm's provided by other plugins), from which a user can choose.

This Programm is included in binary format. You can look into the sources at 
svn://svn.openslx.org/srv/svn/openslx/openslx-src-tools/os-plugins/plugins/vmchooser/

preconfigured. Parts of the configuration are taken from an xml file which 
should be provided with each container file. You will find additional infor-
