VirtualMachine Chooser - plugin
===============================


Please consider to run "make" in the folder src/vmchooser/ after any changes to the code.
Static libraries of fltk-2 are in src/fltk-2/ and are used to link against the program.



BUGS: 

static version:
 - Has to be run with "nice ./vmchooser", else there is a bug in the Xorg system,
   therefore I suggest compiling the shared version for development purposes.

   Simply change "STATIC=-static" to "STATIC= #-static" to enable the shared version.


TODO:
 - enable linux-serssions
 - enable callbacks on entries <- Very important.


ATTENTION:
 This program is not yet released ;-)
